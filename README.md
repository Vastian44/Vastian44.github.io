This repository contains all the relevant material for my final project in the DTU course "Social Data Analysis and Visualizations (course no. 02806). The final project consists of two parts:

1. A website which tells the story of my analysis on the the historic NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset.
2. An explainer notebook which goes into greater detail of the data analysis and contain all the code for the project.

The website can be found here: https://vastian44.github.io/

The dataset can found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data

The explainer notebook can be found in the "jupyter_notebooks" folder.
