Gun crime is a major topic in modern America. In 2023, nearly 47.000 people in the US died from gun related injuries [[1]](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/05/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-us/). Compared to other large western nations, the US has significantly higher rates of gun violence. For example, firearm homicide rates in the US are 19 times greater than in France and 77 times greater than in Germany [[2]](https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/insights-blog/acting-data/gun-violence-united-states-outlier). It is a controversial debate however, as the question of gun ownership is a matter of constitutional right. In this project, we take an analytical approach to investigating the shooting data in the largest city in the US - New York City.

The dataset on which this analysis is built is the historic NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset which is available on the NYC OpenData portal. The dataset can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data). It contains details of every shooting incident in NYC in the time period 2006-2023. It has approximately 29000 observations each containing interesting features such as date, time and location of the shooting as well as age group, race and sex of both the perpetrator and the victim.
